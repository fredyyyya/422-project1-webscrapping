#### Question (f) - Summarizing

"""
Question 1(f) Answer:

Out of 600 Amazon gift cards recently sold on eBay, about 41% were sold above face value! That's really surprising. 
My guess initially was that a few people might have purchased it my mistake. But it couldn't have been that prevalent. 

After some Google searching, I found out that most of these situations are due to fraud. 
People who used stolen credit cards or other accounts to buy gift cards listed by themselves, 
essentially milking money from the stolen credientials. This made more sense. 
But at almost half of the gift card transitions, this is still quite alarming.
